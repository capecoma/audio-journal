## Authentication System Implementation

### Database Schema Setup
1. Created users table with the following fields:
   - id (Primary Key)
   - username (unique)
   - email (unique)
   - password (hashed)
   - created_at

2. Created entries and summaries tables with proper foreign key relationships:
   - entries.userId references users.id
   - summaries.userId references users.id

### Authentication Routes
Implemented the following authentication endpoints:
- POST /api/register - User registration
- POST /api/login - User login
- POST /api/logout - User logout
- GET /api/user - Get current user information

### Security Features
1. Password Hashing
   - Using crypto.scrypt for secure password hashing
   - Implementing salt for additional security
   - Timing-safe password comparison

2. Session Management
   - Express session with MemoryStore
   - Passport.js local strategy
   - Secure cookie configuration for production

### Frontend Integration
1. User Authentication Flow
   - Login/Register forms with validation
   - Protected routes
   - Automatic redirect to login page
   - Session persistence

2. React Query Integration
   - useUser hook for managing auth state
