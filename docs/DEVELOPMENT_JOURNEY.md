# Development Journey

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Audio Processing

#### Challenge: Recording Implementation
Initially struggled with implementing reliable audio recording using the Web Audio API.

**Solution:**
- Created a custom Recorder component
- Implemented proper cleanup of audio streams
- Added visual feedback for recording state
- Fixed memory leaks in audio handling

### 2. Transcription Service

#### Challenge: Large File Processing
Had issues with large audio files timing out during transcription.

**Solution:**
- Implemented chunked upload
- Added progress indicators
- Optimized file format before sending to API
- Improved error handling for failed transcriptions

### 3. Daily Insights Generation

#### Challenge: Date Handling
Encountered issues with timezone differences affecting daily summary generation.

**Solution:**
- Standardized date handling using date-fns
- Improved date range comparisons
- Added proper error handling for sentiment calculations
